# Quant Macro Finance
Quant Macro Finance (QMF) is a series of self-contained online texts intended to accompany Professor Lars Peter Hansen's lectures on Asset Pricing I.
QMF provides students with the pedagogical and coding resources required to solve <b>dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models</b> (DSGE). The objective is to observe how varying modelling assumptions and parameters can affect:
<u1>
<li> <i>Stationary densities</i>, the distribution of variables of interest under stationarity, and </li>
<li> <i>Shock-exposure elasticities</i>, which capture the exposure of macroeconomic processes to shocks over different investment horizons </li>
<li> <i>Shock-price elasticities</i>, which capture changes in risk compensations associated with shock exposures over different investment horizons</li>
</u1>
<br>
<p>The series is divided into <i>discrete and local</i> and <i>continuous and global</i> methods. Local methods are based on perturbing around the steady state in order to approximate policy and valuation functions in a neighbourhood around the steady state, whereas global methods allow us to compute these functions across the domain.</p>
